VERSION 1 (Recommended - Direct & Clear)
==========================================

I wrote the OOP guide I wish existed when I started learning Python.

Most tutorials teach syntax with toy examples that don't need OOP. They skip the paradigm shift from functional thinking and never address the real challenge: deciding what goes where.

This guide is different:

- Why OOP feels alien (functional vs stateful thinking)
- Everything is an object (even functions)
- Use cases that genuinely need OOP
- Paying it forward: @property, __str__, __repr__
- Polymorphism with real examples
- Plugin architecture (sophisticated example)
- The hard part: deciding what does what
- Design patterns as a path forward

It's honest about the confusion, practical about the payoff, and addresses the architectural decisions that paralyze you after learning syntax.

If you've struggled with OOP or know someone who has, this might help.

VERSION 2 (Shorter Hook)
==========================================

Object-Oriented Programming clicked for me when I stopped memorizing syntax and started understanding why it exists.

I wrote the guide I needed back then:

- Why OOP feels alien (paradigm shift)
- Everything is an object (even functions)
- Use cases that genuinely need OOP
- @property, __str__, __repr__ (the polish)
- Plugin architecture example
- The hard part: deciding what does what
- Path to design patterns

It addresses what most tutorials skip: the architectural thinking that matters after you learn syntax.

VERSION 3 (Problem-Focused)
==========================================

You learned classes and inheritance. You passed the exercises. But when you try to build something real, you're stuck: Should this be a method? Which class owns this behavior?

The syntax is easy. The design decisions are hard.

I wrote an OOP guide that addresses this:

- Functional vs OOP paradigm shift
- Everything is an object (you're already using it)
- Examples that need OOP (not toy tasks)
- @property, __str__, __repr__ explained
- Plugin architecture (real sophistication)
- What does what (the actual challenge)
- Design patterns pathway

Honest about the confusion, practical about the payoff.
